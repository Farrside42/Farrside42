- 👋 Hi, I’m @Farrside42
- 👀 I’m interested in developing solutions to better provide cryptographic services (signing, encryption, hashing, etc.) and key management.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning so many things and that there is still so much I don't know.
- 💞️ My Holy Grail is a holistic key managment and governance system which works across on-prem and cloud platforms.
- 📫 Reach me at karen_reinhardt@homedepot.com
